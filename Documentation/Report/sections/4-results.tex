\label{chapter:results}
The results presented were obtained from 5 individual runs for each test case to avoid outliers bias our results. The ranges for each test case (section \ref{methods:tests}) were sampled with 200 points each, except the range to extrapolate the results to other cases that was sampled with 450 points. The mean performance of each heuristic is shown in milliseconds.
