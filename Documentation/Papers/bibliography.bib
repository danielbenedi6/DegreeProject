abstract = {This paper develops the multidimensional binary search tree (or k-d tree, where k is the dimensionality of the search space) as a data structure for storage of information to be retrieved by associative searches. The k-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.},

  abstract={This paper presents parallel algorithms for the construction of k dimensional tree (KD-tree) and nearest neighbor search (NNS) on massively parallel architecture (MPA) of graphics processing unit (GPU). Unlike previous parallel algorithms for KD-tree, for the first time, our parallel algorithms integrate high dimensional KD-tree construction and NNS on an MPA platform. The proposed massively parallel algorithms are of comparable quality as traditional sequential counterparts on CPU, while achieve high speedup performance on both low and high dimensional KD-tree. Low dimensional KD-tree construction and NNS algorithms, presented in this paper, outperform their serial CPU counterparts by a factor of up to 24 and 218, respectively. For high dimensional KD-tree, the speedup factors are even higher, raising to 30 and 242, respectively. Our implementations will potentially benefit real time three-dimensional (3D) image registration and high dimensional descriptor matching.},

  abstract={Though a large variety of efficiency structures for ray tracing exist, kd-trees today seem to slowly become the method of choice. In particular, kd-trees built with cost estimation functions such as a surface area heuristic (SAH) seem to be important for reaching high performance. Unfortunately, most algorithms for building such trees have a time complexity of O(N log<sup>2</sup> N), or even O(N<sup>2</sup>). In this paper, we analyze the state of the art in building good kd-trees for ray tracing, and eventually propose an algorithm that builds SAH kd-trees in O(N log N), the theoretical lower bound},

abstract = {Abstract We introduce the curve complexity heuristic (CCH), a KD-tree construction strategy for 3D curves, which enables interactive exploration of neighborhoods in dense and large line datasets. It can be applied to searches of k-nearest curves (KNC) as well as radius-nearest curves (RNC). The CCH KD-tree construction consists of two steps: (i) 3D curve decomposition that takes into account curve complexity and (ii) KD-tree construction, which involves a novel splitting and early termination strategy. The obtained KD-tree allows us to improve the speed of existing neighborhood search approaches by at least an order of magnitude (i. e., 28×for KNC and 12×for RNC with 98\% accuracy) by considering local curve complexity. We validate this performance with a quantitative evaluation of the quality of search results and computation time. Also, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach for supporting various applications such as interactive line queries, line opacity optimization, and line abstraction.},
